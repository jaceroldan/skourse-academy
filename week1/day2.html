                    <p>I'm a full-stack web developer. I like being in touch with my own growth and self development. Part of that is getting more acquainted with all the technologies in the modern internet. I'm not an expert in any of them, but I like the journey of doing more with them.</p>
                    <p>I'm always seeking opportunities where I can interact with people and approach problems with them, whether that be in computer science or IT, or in learning about going through life's struggles.</p>
